# Mini-departureboard

### Project
In this project, I am creating a small departureboard for the public transport system in Norway.
I am using the raspberry pi pico w and a pimoroni pico display 2.0 to collect and display the data.
I will be using Enturs journneyplanner: "https://developer.entur.org/pages-journeyplanner-journeyplanner", to collect and format the departure-data. The data is available in a graphql format.
Adittionally, I will add information about the weather through the Yr api: "https://developer.yr.no/doc/".

In the end, I should have a small device that can replace some of my phones practical functionalities.
